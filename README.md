Business Application Sandbox

Basix/CE (core edition) is a development environment based on Vaadin framework and Scripting language
Currently it uses Vaadin 6 for compatibility with my other Vaadin project

HOWTO

run Maven compile

mvn:compile
and compile it's widget set

The application will extensively use Groovy as end-user development language

Suggestion for development of this project is expected.
